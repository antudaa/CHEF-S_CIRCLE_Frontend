  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `pages/`: Different page components for each route in the application.
  - `redux/`: Redux store configuration and slices for state management.
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helper methods.
- `public/`: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite.

## üåü Features

- **Recipe Sharing**: Add, edit, and delete various types like Indian, Thai, and more.
- **Rating System**: Manage Recipe Rating, including proper validation, with ease.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management using Redux for state management.
- **Payment Processing**: Manage premium access payments and track payment statuses.

## üîß Configuration

### Vite Configuration

Vite is used for fast development and build processes. The default configuration is set up in `vite.config.ts`. To customize the configuration, refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

### ESLint Configuration

ESLint ensures code quality and adherence to coding standards. To maintain code consistency:

1. Configure the top-level `parserOptions` in `.eslintrc.js`:
    ```js
    export default {
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 'latest',
        sourceType: 'module',
        project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
      },
      // other rules...
    }
    ```

2. Update ESLint rules:
    - Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.
    - Optionally, include `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked` for stylistic type checking.

3. Install `eslint-plugin-react` and add the following to the `extends` list:
    ```json
    "extends": [
      "plugin:react/recommended",
      "plugin:react/jsx-runtime"
    ]
    ```

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. Ensure you have the proper Tailwind configuration in place:

- `tailwind.config.js`: Customize the Tailwind configuration to fit the design requirements.

## üåê Deployment

Deploy the application using a platform like Vercel. Make sure the `vercel.json` file is properly configured for deployment. For more details on deployment, refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

## üìò Documentation

Refer to the in-code documentation and comments for a better understanding of the components and their usage. Additionally, the project includes:
- **API Integration**: Handles recipe data, user authentication, and premium access using a centralized Redux API slice.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures robust type checking and reduces runtime errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build` / `yarn build`: Build the application for production.
- `npm run lint` / `yarn lint`: Run ESLint for code quality checks.
- `npm run preview` / `yarn preview`: Preview the production build locally.

### Coding Standards

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript style guide.
- Ensure consistent code formatting using Prettier.
- Write unit tests for critical components using Jest and React Testing Library.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication using JWT and state management with Redux.
